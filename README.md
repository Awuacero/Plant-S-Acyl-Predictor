# Plant-S-Acyl-Predictor 🌿

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://plant-s-acyl-predictor.streamlit.app/)

A biophysical pre-filtering pipeline (UHS & Kyte-Doolittle) integrated with an optimized MusiteDeep ensemble model for plant S-acylation prediction.

## Overview

Characterizing the plant S-acylome presents significant challenges due to the high false-positive rates inherent to chemical enrichment methods (such as the Biotin-Switch assay) and the scarcity of predictive models optimized specifically for plant proteomes. 

**Plant-S-Acyl-Predictor** overcomes these limitations by acting as a high-stringency "digital negative control". This tool couples sequence-based deep learning architectures with biophysical surface accessibility filters, allowing researchers to purify raw experimental mass spectrometry datasets without the need for double biological sample inputs.

## Features

Built as an interactive Streamlit application, this pipeline executes a multi-layered filtration process:

*   **Sequence Pre-filtering:** Parses uploaded `.fasta` files and automatically discards any sequences lacking target Cysteine ('C') substrates.
*   **Biophysical Accessibility Analysis:** Utilizes a sliding window algorithm to evaluate local surface exposure of cysteines. It strictly filters candidates using two complementary scales: the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy scale and the Unified Hydrophobicity Scale (UHS).
*   **Deep Learning Integration:** Structurally viable candidates with solvent-exposed cysteines are then seamlessly passed to a locally executed MusiteDeep model for S-palmitoylation site prediction.
*   **Data Export:** Generates downloadable CSV files with the high-confidence accessible cysteines and full textual reports of the MusiteDeep predictions.

## Usage (Web App)

The easiest way to use the pipeline is through our hosted Streamlit application. No installation is required.

1. Navigate to [Plant-S-Acyl-Predictor on Streamlit](https://plant-s-acyl-predictor.streamlit.app/).
2. Upload your `.fasta` file.
3. Adjust the sliding window size and the maximum hydrophobicity cutoffs (KD and UHS).
4. Download the filtered sequence or run the deep learning prediction directly.
